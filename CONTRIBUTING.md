# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## How to contribute
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`.
2. If adding tests/data:
   - Use the CSV templates in `tests/templates/`.
   - Keep examples anonymized (no private data).
3. Update docs if behavior changes.
4. Open a Pull Request with a clear description and examples.

## Coding & Data Guidelines
- Prefer English for docs; keep language-specific examples in their native language.
- No sensitive or personal data in transcripts.
- Keep CSVs tidy: one test per row, fill all columns when possible.
