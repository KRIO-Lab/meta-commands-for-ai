# Test Plan for Meta-Commands for AI

## Objectives
- Validate the effectiveness of meta-commands in improving human-AI interaction.
- Measure efficiency gains, error reduction, and user satisfaction.
- Assess reproducibility and consistency of AI behavior across repeated sessions.

## Test Categories

### 1. Command Accuracy
- Verify that AI correctly interprets and executes each meta-command.
- Check for misinterpretations or unexpected outputs.
- Example: Prompt "summarize article" and compare output against predefined checklist.

### 2. Workflow Efficiency
- Measure time saved using meta-commands vs standard verbose prompts.
- Record number of interactions required to achieve the same result.
- Example: Completing a coding task or research summary using meta-commands.

### 3. Error Reduction
- Count the number of errors in outputs produced with vs without meta-commands.
- Include grammatical, formatting, or structural inconsistencies.

### 4. Cross-Domain Testing
- Apply meta-commands in different contexts: coding, research, project management, data analysis.
- Verify that AI behavior remains consistent.

### 5. User Satisfaction
- Gather qualitative feedback from users regarding ease of use and intuitiveness.
- Evaluate how much mental overhead is reduced.

### 6. Custom Meta-Commands
- Test user-defined commands for correctness and reproducibility.
- Example: "update task list" or "preprocess dataset".

## Data Collection
- Save all outputs for comparison.
- Record time stamps and session lengths.
- Document user feedback in structured format (survey/questionnaire).

## Success Criteria
- â‰¥90% of meta-commands correctly executed by AI.
- Measurable reduction in user interactions and time to complete tasks.
- Positive user feedback on efficiency and clarity.
- Consistent AI behavior across domains and sessions.
