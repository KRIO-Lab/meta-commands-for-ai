# Test Plan

## Test 1: Efficiency
- Compare number of tokens used in standard vs. meta-command conversations.
- Example: "Complete the note" vs. full multi-step instruction.

## Test 2: Naturalness
- Ask users to rate the quality and naturalness of responses.
- Measure if meta-commands feel more conversational.

## Test 3: Consistency
- Verify if AI respects grammar/gender cues reliably.
- Example: use of feminine vs. masculine forms in Polish.

## Test 4: Generalization
- Check if meta-commands can be reused across different contexts and models.
