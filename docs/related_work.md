## Human–AI Communication
- Most research focuses on prompt engineering, often verbose and case-specific.
- No established standard for "compressed prompts" or meta-language.

## Similar Concepts
- Macros in software (shortcuts to complex operations).
- DSLs (domain-specific languages).
- Human conversational shorthands (nicknames, metaphors, agreed terms).

## Gap
- Lack of systematic testing for meta-commands in AI communication.
- Limited focus on grammar–gender mismatch in LLMs.
