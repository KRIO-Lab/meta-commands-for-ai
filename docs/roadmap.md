# Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Hypothesis
- Draft core concept and create repository
- Collect examples of meta-commands
- Define minimal working framework

### Phase 2 — Testing
- Run controlled tests with meta-commands vs. standard prompts
- Measure efficiency (tokens saved, response quality)
- Collect subjective user ratings (naturalness, satisfaction)

### Phase 3 — Expansion
- Explore grammar–gender applications
- Extend tests to multiple languages (Polish, Spanish, Arabic)
- Publish libraries of reusable meta-commands

### Phase 4 — Community
- Open the project for contributions
- Gather real-world feedback
- Create reference implementations
