# Originality Assessment of Meta-Commands for AI

## Scope
This document evaluates the originality of the "Meta-Commands for AI" project in the context of existing research and practical implementations.

## Comparison with Existing Work
- **Prompt Engineering Repositories:** Many GitHub repositories provide templates and prompt engineering guides, but they often lack a standardized meta-language approach.
- **Meta-Prompting Research:** Formal studies of meta-prompting exist, but primarily focus on task decomposition, not on consistent shorthand commands or grammatical consistency.
- **Human Conversational Shorthands:** Everyday shorthand in human dialogue (nicknames, metaphors) is not formally leveraged in AI meta-commands.

## Unique Contributions
- Definition of a lightweight, user-definable meta-language for AI commands.
- Integration of meta-commands across multiple domains: coding, research, project management, data analysis.
- Introduction of user-specified grammatical and interactional preferences (e.g., via `Sora` meta-command).
- Emphasis on cross-domain consistency and structured outputs.

## Potential Overlaps
- Some meta-prompting techniques may partially overlap with `mixed commands` examples.
- Existing DSLs and macro systems in software share conceptual similarities with structured sequences in meta-commands.

## Conclusion
The project is largely original in formalizing user-defined meta-commands for AI and integrating interaction style preferences. While conceptual overlaps exist, the practical implementation and scope provide a unique contribution to humanâ€“AI communication.
