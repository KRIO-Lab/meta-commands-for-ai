# Concept: Meta-Commands for AI

## Hypothesis
Meta-commands simplify communication with AI by acting as linguistic shortcuts, reducing cognitive and interactional overhead.

## Problem Space
- Current prompts are verbose and repetitive.
- Users struggle with grammar mismatches in gendered languages.
- No standardized way to define "shorthand" communication with AI.

## Proposed Solution
- Define and test a lightweight "meta-language" for humanâ€“AI dialogue.
- Document efficiency gains (time saved, reduced errors, more natural feel).
- Provide reusable libraries of meta-commands for different tasks.
